            <!-- "In the Bloomberg Women in Finance program, I gained valuable insights into finance while drawing inspiration from the remarkable <br>women who guided me throughout this transformative journey. On the inaugural day, Ashima Ma'am shared profound wisdom that <br>transcends the financial realm, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and prioritizing one's health—a fragile 'glass ball' <br>that, if dropped, can shatter.
            
            <br>The program delved into diverse financial topics, equipping me with practical knowledge such as utilizing the Bloomberg Terminal, <br>understanding mutual funds, discerning between buy-side and sell-side services, exploring insurance brokerage, comprehending asset <br>fund investment strategies, navigating the short and futures marketplace, and unraveling the roles of analysts, managers, traders,<br> and investors. We also explored the intricacies of stock ownership and the intriguing world of IPOs through terminal decoders.<br>
            
            A highlight of the program was the National Stock Exchange visit, where I witnessed real-world trading and had the privilege of <br>learning from industry leaders. Their insights were invaluable, reinforcing the significance of financial independence for every <br>woman. The experience fueled my curiosity about investment strategies, company research, and the dynamic landscape of the financial world.<br>
            
            Bloomberg Terminal became my gateway to exploring national and international equity, decoding securities, and launching in-depth <br>research on companies. The program not only broadened my financial knowledge but also instilled in me the courage to forge ahead <br>and cultivate a genuine interest in the financial domain.<br>
            
            The interaction with the owner of the National Stock Exchange was a pinnacle moment, providing a rare glimpse into their experiences <br>and adding a layer of real-world context to our learning. I left the program with newfound confidence, a deeper understanding of <br>financial intricacies, and a strong motivation to continue exploring and growing in the financial world.<br>
            
            <br>In essence, the Apac Women in Finance program offered me an incredible learning journey, sparking my interest and providing me <br>with a solid foundation in finance. My gratitude for this enriching experience knows no bounds." </P> -->
